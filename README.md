## Features
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications secured with TLS 1.2/1.3 using strong cipher suites
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Secure withdrawals with TOTP-based 2FA
- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request throttling with progressive penalties for abuse
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed security and transaction logs for auditing and compliance
- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Identifies and blocks suspicious activities and potential attacks
- **High Performance**: Connection pooling and multi-threading for optimal throughput
- **Database Security**: Secure transaction storage with parameterized queries to prevent injection
- **API Integration**: Connects with exchange rate and swap APIs to enable seamless transactions

## System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenSSL 1.1.1+**
- **2GB RAM minimum (4GB+ recommended)**
- **50MB disk space** (plus storage for logs and database)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-organization/cryptosentinel.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Generate SSL certificates:**
    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
    ```

4. **Configure environment variables (optional):**
    ```bash
    export SENTINEL_AUTH_TOKEN="your_secure_token"
    ```

## Quick Start

1. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    python sentinel_server.py
    ```
    The server will run on port 5000 by default (configurable).

## Configuration Options
| Environment Variable       | Description                                    | Default                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `SENTINEL_AUTH_TOKEN`       | Authentication token for API requests         | Random generated token       |
| `SENTINEL_PORT`             | Server listening port                          | 5000                         |
| `RATE_LIMIT`                | Maximum requests per minute                    | 20                           |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`         | Time window for rate limiting (seconds)        | 60                           |
| `API_TIMEOUT`               | Timeout for external API calls (seconds)       | 5                            |

## API Endpoints
- **Receive Payment**: Generate address for receiving crypto/fiat
- **Swap Cryptocurrencies**: Exchange between different tokens
- **Withdraw Funds**: Send crypto to external wallets (2FA protected)
- **Get Exchange Rates**: Retrieve current market rates
- **Transaction History**: View past transactions

## Security Recommendations
- Run in an isolated environment (Docker/VM)
- Restrict firewall access to the server port
- Regularly rotate credentials and update dependencies
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities
- Implement regular database backups
- Use VPN or private network for server access

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection refused**: Check if the server is running and port is accessible
- **Authentication errors**: Verify `AUTH_TOKEN` is correctly set
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Reduce request frequency or increase `RATE_LIMIT`
- **Database errors**: Check disk space and permissions
