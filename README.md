Restrict firewall access to server port
Regularly rotate credentials and update dependencies
Monitor logs for suspicious activities
Implement regular database backups
Use VPN or private network for server access

Authentication errors: Verify AUTH_TOKEN is correctly set
Rate limit exceeded: Reduce request frequency or increase RATE_LIMIT
Database errors: Check disk space and permissions
